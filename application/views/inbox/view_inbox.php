To add a new level click the New Level button on the top of the Level List table.

Add New Level

The Add Level form shown above has two fields, namely Name, and Description.

The level Name is where you specify the unique name that is used to identify each level.

You can enter a short description about the level in the Description field. This will help in figuring out which requests can be classified under this level, unless ofcourse, the level name itself is explanatory. 

Click the Save button to save the level and return to the list view.</div>
